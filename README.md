<h2 align="center">Autonomous plan execution with Claude Code and codex</h2>

*ralphex is a standalone CLI tool that runs in your terminal from the root of a git repository. It orchestrates Claude Code or codex to execute implementation plans autonomously - no IDE plugins or cloud services required, just a coding agent and a single binary.*

Claude Code is powerful but interactive - it requires you to watch, approve, and guide each step. For complex features spanning multiple tasks, this means hours of babysitting. Worse, as context fills up during long sessions, the model's quality degrades - it starts making mistakes, forgetting earlier decisions, and producing worse code.

ralphex solves both problems. Each task executes in a fresh Claude Code session with minimal context, keeping the model sharp throughout the entire plan. Write a plan with tasks and validation commands, start ralphex, and walk away. Come back to find your feature implemented, reviewed, and committed - or check the progress log to see what it's doing.

- **Worktree isolation** - run multiple plans in parallel via `--worktree` flag
- **Multiple modes** - full execution, tasks-only, review-only, external-only, or plan creation

## Quick Start

Make sure ralphex is [installed](#installation) and your project is a git repository. You need a  [plan file](#plan-creation) in `docs/plans/`, for example:

```markdown
# Plan: My Feature

## Validation Commands
- `go test ./...`

### Task 1: Implement feature
- [ ] Add the new functionality
- [ ] Add tests
```

Then run:

```bash
ralphex docs/plans/my-feature.md
```

ralphex will create a branch, execute tasks, commit results, run multi-phase reviews, and move the plan to `completed/` when done.

> [!WARNING]
> **Anthropic Agent SDK billing change on June 15, 2026**
>
> Anthropic is moving `claude -p` / `claude --print`, Claude Agent SDK, and Claude Code GitHub Actions usage to a separate monthly Agent SDK credit pool for Claude subscription users. The default Claude mode in ralphex uses `claude --print` internally, so unattended ralphex runs are part of that pool. See Anthropic's [Agent SDK credit article](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan) for the current billing rules.
>
> Practical options:
>
> 1. Do nothing. Light use may fit inside the included monthly credit. This should also be transparent for users who already run Claude Code through API-key billing, Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, or another non-subscription provider path.
> 2. Use a skill-based flow in an interactive Claude Code session. The author's [`umputun/cc-thingz`](https://github.com/umputun/cc-thingz) plugin collection includes the `planning` family (`/planning:make` and `/planning:exec`). That keeps work inside the normal interactive Claude Code flow instead of `claude --print`.
> 3. Switch the ralphex executor to codex. First-class [`--codex`](#codex-executor-mode) support routes plan creation, task execution, both review phases, and finalize through the codex CLI and skips the external codex review phase.
> 4. Use a `claude -p` compatible wrapper that drives an interactive Claude Code session and emits Claude-compatible `stream-json`. Examples that match ralphex's invocation shape include [`umputun/fya`](https://github.com/umputun/fya), [`melonamin/agentrun`](https://github.com/melonamin/agentrun), [`Equality-Machine/claude-p`](https://github.com/Equality-Machine/claude-p), and [`kcosr/claude-pty-wrapper`](https://github.com/kcosr/claude-pty-wrapper). These wrappers are unofficial and may break if Anthropic changes or blocks this pattern.

<details markdown>
<summary>Wrapper configuration examples</summary>

Install `fya` with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install umputun/apps/fya
command -v fya
```

Use the absolute path printed by `command -v fya` in ralphex config. On Apple Silicon Homebrew this is normally `/opt/homebrew/bin/fya`:

```ini
# in ~/.config/ralphex/config or .ralphex/config
claude_command = /opt/homebrew/bin/fya
claude_args = --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json --verbose
```

On Intel Homebrew the path is normally `/usr/local/bin/fya`. If `command -v fya` prints another path, use that exact path instead.

For `agentrun`, use its tmux-backed path if the goal is avoiding direct `claude --print`:

```ini
claude_command = /absolute/path/to/agentrun
claude_args = --persist-session --no-session-persistence --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json --verbose
```

These tools depend on interactive Claude Code behavior and local transcript files staying usable. Anthropic may detect or block wrapper-style automation later, so test the exact tool before relying on it.

</details>

## How It Works

ralphex executes plans in four phases with automated code reviews, plus an optional finalize step.

<details markdown>
<summary>Execution Flow Diagram</summary>

![ralphex flow](assets/ralphex-flow.png)

</details>

### Phase 1: Task Execution

1. Reads plan file and finds first incomplete task (`### Task N:` with `- [ ]` checkboxes)
2. Sends task to Claude Code for execution
3. Runs validation commands (tests, linters) after each task
4. Marks checkboxes as done `[x]`, commits changes
5. Repeats until all tasks complete or max iterations reached

**Steering mid-run:** Press Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT) during a task iteration to pause execution. ralphex cancels the current Claude session and prompts "press Enter to continue, Ctrl+C to abort". While paused, you can edit the plan file — on Enter, the same task re-runs with a fresh session that re-reads the plan. Press Ctrl+C to abort cleanly. Not available on Windows.

### Phase 2: First Code Review

Launches 5 review agents **in parallel** via Claude Code Task tool:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `quality` | bugs, security issues, race conditions |
| `implementation` | verifies code achieves stated goals |
| `testing` | test coverage and quality |
| `simplification` | detects over-engineering |
| `documentation` | checks if docs need updates |

Claude verifies findings, fixes confirmed issues, and commits.

*[Default agents](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/tree/master/pkg/config/defaults/agents) provide common, language-agnostic review steps. They can be customized and tuned for your specific needs, languages, and workflows. See [Customization](#customization) for details.*

### Phase 3: External Review (optional)

1. Runs external review tool (codex by default, or custom script)
2. Claude evaluates findings, fixes valid issues
3. Iterates until no open issues

The loop terminates when: all issues resolved, max iterations reached, stalemate detected (via `--review-patience`), or manual break via Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT).

**Stalemate detection:** When the external tool and Claude can't agree on findings, the loop can waste tokens iterating to the max. Set `--review-patience=N` (or `review_patience` in config) to terminate after N consecutive rounds with no commits or working tree changes.

**Manual break:** Press Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT) during the external review loop to terminate it immediately. The current executor run is cancelled via context cancellation. During the task phase, Ctrl+\ pauses instead — see [Phase 1: Task Execution](#phase-1-task-execution). Not available on Windows.

Supported tools:
- **codex** (default): OpenAI Codex for independent code review
- **custom**: Your own script wrapping any AI (OpenRouter, local LLM, etc.)
- **none**: Skip external review entirely

See [Custom External Review](#custom-external-review) for details on using custom scripts.

### Phase 4: Second Code Review

1. Launches 2 agents (`quality` + `implementation`) for final review
2. Focuses on critical/major issues only
3. Iterates until no issues found
4. Moves plan to `completed/` folder on success

*Second review agents are configurable via `prompts/review_second.txt`.*

### Finalize Step (optional)

After all review phases complete successfully, ralphex can run an optional finalize step. Disabled by default.

**What it does:** runs a single Claude Code session with a customizable prompt. The default `finalize.txt` prompt rebases commits onto the default branch and optionally squashes related commits into logical groups.

**How to enable:**

Set `finalize_enabled = true` in `~/.config/ralphex/config` or `.ralphex/config`.

**Behavior:**
- Runs once (no iteration loop)
- Best-effort — failures are logged but don't block success
- Triggers on modes with review pipeline: full, review-only, external-only
- Uses task color (green) for output

**Customization:**

Edit `~/.config/ralphex/prompts/finalize.txt` (or `.ralphex/prompts/finalize.txt`) to change what happens after reviews. Examples: push to remote, send notifications, run deployment scripts, or any post-completion automation. Template variables like `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` are available.

### Plan Move Behavior (optional)

After successful execution, ralphex moves the plan file into `docs/plans/completed/`. Enabled by default.

**How to disable:**

Set `move_plan_on_completion = false` in `~/.config/ralphex/config` or `.ralphex/config`. Default is `true`.

**When to disable:** workflows that manage plan file lifecycle externally (e.g. spec-driven tooling where the plan lives inside a bundle that a separate archive step consumes) should opt out so ralphex doesn't fight the external tool's file layout.

### Review-Only Mode

Review-only mode (`--review`) runs the full review pipeline (Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4) on changes already present on the current branch. This is useful when changes were made outside ralphex — via Claude Code's built-in plan mode, manual edits, other AI agents, or any other workflow.

**Workflow:**

1. Make changes on a feature branch (using any tool or workflow)
2. Commit the changes
3. Run `ralphex --review`

ralphex compares the branch against the default branch (`git diff master...HEAD`), launches multi-agent reviews, and iterates fixes until all agents report clean. No plan file is required — if provided, it gives reviewers additional context about the intended changes.

```bash
# switch to feature branch with existing changes
git checkout feature-auth

# run review pipeline on those changes
ralphex --review

# optionally pass a plan file for context
ralphex --review docs/plans/add-auth.md
```

### External-Only Mode

External-only mode (`--external-only`, alias `-e`) skips the task and first review phases and runs the external review pipeline (Phase 3 → Phase 4) on changes already present on the current branch. The flag name follows the same cutoff convention as `--review`: it marks where execution starts, not which single phase runs. After the external review loop converges (or hits its iteration limit), the post-external critical/major review (Phase 4) runs to catch regressions from fixes applied during the loop.

If the external review loop finds no issues on its first pass, Phase 4 is skipped automatically because there is nothing to regress.

```bash
# run external review pipeline on current branch changes
ralphex --external-only

# optionally pass a plan file for context
ralphex --external-only docs/plans/feature.md
```

### Codex Executor Mode

The `--codex` flag routes interactive plan creation (`--plan`), task execution, both review phases, and the optional finalize step through the codex CLI instead of Claude Code. The external review phase is automatically skipped because codex-reviewing-codex is a same-model self-review with weak signal; the cross-model independence between Claude and codex was the original reason that phase existed.

**Why this exists:** in June 2026 Anthropic split the Claude Max subscription from the Claude Agent SDK, putting unattended ralphex runs on a separate $200 credit pool rather than the Max plan. Users with an OpenAI/codex plan can switch the entire ralphex pipeline to codex with one flag and stay on their existing OpenAI subscription instead.

```bash
# create a plan through codex
ralphex --codex --plan "add user authentication"

# run the full pipeline (task, first review, second review, finalize) through codex
ralphex --codex docs/plans/feature.md

# additionally let codex read project CLAUDE.md as AGENTS.md
ralphex --codex --pass-claude-md docs/plans/feature.md
```

**How it differs from `codex-as-claude.sh`:** the `--codex` flag is the native codex path. It calls the codex CLI directly and configures multi-agent reviews through additive `-c` flag overrides on the codex command line. Review prompts are shared with claude. The `{{agent:<name>}}` expansion produces `spawn_agent` calls for codex and Task-tool calls for claude at runtime. The `scripts/codex-as-claude/codex-as-claude.sh` wrapper still exists for backwards compatibility. It translates codex JSONL output into Claude stream-json events, which adds overhead and keeps Claude-flavored prompt vocabulary in front of a codex model.

**Project CLAUDE.md passthrough (`--pass-claude-md`):** adds `-c project_doc_fallback_filenames=["CLAUDE.md"]` to the codex invocation so codex's native AGENTS.md walk picks up the project-level `./CLAUDE.md` file. This works for project-level CLAUDE.md only. For user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, ralphex never modifies the user's `~/.codex/` directory. If `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` exists and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` does not, ralphex prints a one-time hint suggesting `ln -s ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and continues; the user opts in by running the command themselves.

**Configuration alternative:** instead of passing `--codex` every run, set it in `~/.config/ralphex/config` or `.ralphex/config`:

```ini
executor       = codex
pass_claude_md = true
```

When `executor = codex` is set in config and the user has also set `external_review_tool = codex` (or `custom`), ralphex automatically overrides `external_review_tool` to `none` and prints a warning to stderr that the config-file value was overridden. Only CLI-flag conflicts are hard errors; config-only conflicts resolve with a warning.

**Mutual exclusion:** the codex executor (whether enabled via `--codex` or `executor = codex` in config) cannot be combined with `--external-only` (alias `-e`), `--codex-only` (alias `-c`), or `--external-review-tool=<X>` where `<X>` is not `none`. `--pass-claude-md` requires the codex executor (CLI `--codex` or config `executor = codex`). Each combination fails with a clear error message at startup.

**Requirements:** `--codex` requires the codex CLI version 0.130.0 or newer. The mode relies on `[features] multi_agent`, `[agents.<name>]` agent registration, and (with `--pass-claude-md`) `project_doc_fallback_filenames`, all supported in 0.130.0. Older codex versions silently ignore unknown `-c` overrides, so a misconfigured run will not error visibly. It will simply behave as if the overrides were absent. There is no runtime version check; verify your codex version with `codex --version` if behavior is unexpected.

**Model selection under `--codex`:** under `--codex` the `--plan-model` / `--task-model` / `--review-model` flags (and their config equivalents `plan_model` / `task_model` / `review_model`) select the model and effort per phase. `--plan-model` sets plan creation and falls back to `--task-model` when unset. `--task-model` sets the task phase. `--review-model` sets the review phase and falls back to `--task-model` when unset. Codex builds a separate review executor when the resolved review model/effort differs from task, so tasks and reviews can run on different codex models. Each `model[:effort]` spec is resolved against `codex_model` / `codex_reasoning_effort` (default `gpt-5.6-sol` / `high`): an unset spec inherits those defaults, and each populated half overrides its default (`--task-model=:low` changes effort only). The `max` effort level is claude-only. A spec requesting it under `--codex` is warned about and ignored. So codex model selection is: `--plan-model` / `--task-model` / `--review-model` (CLI or config), then `codex_model` / `codex_reasoning_effort` in ralphex config, applied as `-c` overrides to the codex CLI; set either codex value to empty (e.g. `codex_model =`) in your user config to inherit that field from `~/.codex/config.toml` instead. Commenting the line out keeps the embedded default. The startup banner under `--codex` shows the resolved plan/task model/effort for the current mode, plus a separate `review model` / `review reasoning effort` line when the review phase resolves differently.

### Worktree Isolation

The `--worktree` flag runs plan execution in an isolated git worktree at `.ralphex/worktrees/<branch>`, enabling parallel execution of multiple plans on the same repo without branch conflicts.

**Supported modes:** `--worktree` only applies to full mode and `--tasks-only`. It is silently ignored for `--review`, `--external-only`, and `--plan` — these modes operate from the current directory.

**Re-running reviews on a worktree branch:** if the task phase completed in a worktree but the review phase needs to be re-run, `cd` into the worktree directory and run the review from there:

```bash
# find the worktree
ls .ralphex/worktrees/

# run review from inside it
cd .ralphex/worktrees/my-feature-branch
ralphex --review
# or
ralphex --external-only
```

Worktrees are automatically removed on successful completion. If a run is interrupted, the worktree directory may remain and can be reused or removed manually.

### Plan Creation

Plans can be created in several ways:
- **[Claude Code](#claude-code-integration-optional)** - use slash commands like `/ralphex-plan` or your own planning workflows
- **Manually** - write markdown files directly in `docs/plans/`
- **`--plan` flag** - integrated option that handles the entire flow
- **Auto-detection** - running `ralphex` without arguments on master/main prompts for plan creation if no plans exist

The `--plan` flag provides a simpler integrated experience:

```bash
ralphex --plan "add health check endpoint"
```

Claude explores your codebase, asks clarifying questions via a terminal picker (fzf or numbered fallback), and generates a complete plan file in `docs/plans/`. When reviewing the draft, you can accept, revise with text feedback, open it in `$EDITOR` for interactive annotation, or reject it.

**Example session:**
```
$ ralphex --plan "add caching for API responses"
[10:30:05] analyzing codebase structure...
[10:30:12] found existing store layer in pkg/store/

QUESTION: Which cache backend?
  > Redis
    In-memory
    File-based
    Other (type your own answer)

[10:30:45] ANSWER: Redis
[10:31:00] continuing plan creation...
[10:32:05] plan written to docs/plans/add-api-caching.md

Continue with plan implementation?
  > Yes, execute plan
    No, exit
```

After plan creation, you can choose to continue with immediate execution or exit to run ralphex later. Progress is logged to `.ralphex/progress/progress-plan-<name>.txt`.

## Installation

### From source

```bash
go install github.com/umputun/ralphex/cmd/ralphex@latest
```

### Using Homebrew

```bash
brew install umputun/apps/ralphex
```

### From releases

Download the appropriate binary from [releases](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/releases).

### Using Docker

Download the wrapper script and install to PATH:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umputun/ralphex/master/scripts/ralphex-dk.sh -o /usr/local/bin/ralphex
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ralphex
```

The script defaults to the Go image (`ralphex-go`). For other languages, build a custom image from the base with your toolchain installed (see [Available images](#available-images) for examples), then point the wrapper at it:
```bash
export RALPHEX_IMAGE=my-ralphex
```

Then use `ralphex` as usual - it runs in a container with Claude Code and Codex pre-installed. The script shows which image it's using at startup.

**Why use Docker?** ralphex runs Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, giving it full access to execute commands and modify files. Running in a container provides isolation - Claude can only access the mounted project directory, not your entire system. This makes autonomous execution significantly safer.

<details markdown>
<summary>Isolation details</summary>

**Container CAN access (read-write):**
- Project directory mounted at `/workspace` - full access to create, modify, delete files
- Git operations within the project (branch, commit, etc.)

**Container CAN access (read-only):**
- `~/.claude/` - credentials and settings (copied at startup, not modified)
- `~/.codex/` - codex credentials if present
- `~/.config/ralphex/` - user-level ralphex configuration
- `~/.gitconfig` - git identity for commits
- Global gitignore (`core.excludesFile`) - auto-detected and mounted
- `.ralphex/` - project-level configuration if present

**Container CANNOT access:**
- Host filesystem outside mounted directories
- Other projects or repositories
- SSH keys, AWS credentials, or other secrets in `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc.
- System files, binaries, or configurations
- Other running processes or containers

**Network:** Full network access (required for Claude API calls)

**Privileges:** Runs as non-root user with no elevated capabilities

</details>

**Volume mounts:**
- **Read-only**: `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` mounted to `/mnt/`, copied at startup to preserve isolation
- **Read-write**: project directory (`/workspace`) - where ralphex creates branches, edits code, and commits
- **Extra mounts**: user-defined volumes via `-v`/`--volume` flags or `RALPHEX_EXTRA_VOLUMES` env var

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.9+ (for the wrapper script)
- Docker installed and running
- Claude Code credentials in `~/.claude/` (or in `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set)
- Codex credentials in `~/.codex/` (optional, for codex review phase)
- Git config in `~/.gitconfig` (for commits)

**Environment variables:**
- `RALPHEX_IMAGE` - Docker image to use (default: `ghcr.io/umputun/ralphex-go:latest`). CLI flag: `--image`
- `RALPHEX_PORT` - Port for web dashboard when using `--serve` (default: `8080`). CLI flag: `--port`
- `RALPHEX_CONFIG_DIR` - Custom config directory (default: `~/.config/ralphex`). Overrides global config location for prompts, agents, and settings
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` - Claude config directory (default: `~/.claude`). Use for alternate Claude installations (e.g., `~/.claude2`). Works both with Docker wrapper (volume mounts and keychain derivation) and non-Docker usage (passed through to Claude Code directly). Keychain service name is derived automatically from the path.
- `RALPHEX_EXTRA_VOLUMES` - Extra volume mounts, comma-separated (e.g., `/data:/mnt/data:ro,/models:/mnt/models`). Entries without `:` are silently skipped
- `RALPHEX_EXTRA_ENV` - Extra environment variables, comma-separated (e.g., `DEBUG=1,API_KEY`). Format: `VAR=value` or `VAR` (inherit from host). Security warning emitted for sensitive names (KEY, SECRET, TOKEN, etc.) with explicit values - use name-only form for secure credential passing
- `RALPHEX_DOCKER_SOCKET` - Enable Docker socket mount: `1`, `true`, or `yes` (Docker wrapper only). CLI flag: `--docker`
- `RALPHEX_DOCKER_NETWORK` - Docker network mode (e.g., `host`, `my-network`). Useful for reaching docker-compose services. CLI flag: `--network`
- `RALPHEX_CLI_UPDATE` - Refresh claude/codex to their current npm releases at container start: `1`, `true`, or `yes` (Docker images only). Off by default in the base image; baked on in `ralphex-go`
- `TZ` - Override container timezone (default: auto-detected from host via `/etc/localtime`). Example: `TZ=Europe/Berlin ralphex docs/plans/feature.md`
- `RALPHEX_CLAUDE_PROVIDER` - Claude provider mode: `default` or `bedrock` (Docker wrapper only)

**CLI freshness in the container:**

The image installs claude and codex unpinned, so a published tag freezes them at whatever npm served on that build. Both ship far more often than ralphex is tagged, and a stale claude fails silently rather than loudly: a short model alias like `sonnet` resolves to whatever that build knew about, so `--task-model=sonnet` can quietly run an older model. Claude's own updater cannot help here, since npm installs it root-owned and the container runs as the `app` user.

Setting `RALPHEX_CLI_UPDATE=1` refreshes both CLIs to their current npm releases on start, before dropping privileges. It usually adds about 5 seconds and is capped by a 90 second deadline. Best effort: if npm fails or the deadline is hit, the versions baked into the image are used and the run continues. If the install succeeds but a CLI does not run, the container says so rather than failing later without explanation.

The base `ralphex` image leaves this **off** so anyone building on it gets no surprise npm install, network call, or version drift at container start. The `ralphex-go` image (the wrapper's default) bakes it **on**, so the common path stays current. Enable it yourself for a single run:

```bash
RALPHEX_CLI_UPDATE=1 ralphex docs/plans/feature.md
```

Or bake it into a custom image so every run refreshes:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/umputun/ralphex:latest
ENV RALPHEX_CLI_UPDATE=1
```

**Docker socket support:**

The `--docker` flag (or `RALPHEX_DOCKER_SOCKET=1`) mounts the host Docker socket into the container, enabling testcontainers and Docker-dependent workflows:

```bash
ralphex --docker docs/plans/feature.md
ralphex --docker --dry-run   # verify socket mount in command
```

- Auto-detects socket GID and passes `DOCKER_GID` env var for baseimage group setup
- Emits security warning on Linux (macOS has VM isolation, no warning needed)
- Exits with error if socket file doesn't exist (fail-fast, no silent degradation)

**AWS Bedrock support:**

When `--claude-provider=bedrock` or `RALPHEX_CLAUDE_PROVIDER=bedrock` is set:
- Keychain credential extraction is skipped (not needed for Bedrock auth)
- AWS credentials are automatically exported from `AWS_PROFILE` via `aws configure export-credentials`
- Required Bedrock env vars are passed to container: `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `AWS_REGION`, credentials

Required environment for Bedrock:
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region where Bedrock is enabled
- `AWS_PROFILE` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - authentication

Note: `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` is automatically set when using `--claude-provider=bedrock`.

```bash
# with AWS profile (credentials exported automatically)
export AWS_PROFILE=my-bedrock-profile
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
ralphex --claude-provider=bedrock docs/plans/feature.md

# or use env var for session-wide setting
export RALPHEX_CLAUDE_PROVIDER=bedrock
ralphex docs/plans/feature.md
```

See [Bedrock setup documentation](docs/bedrock-setup.md) for detailed IAM policies and setup instructions.

**Extra volume mounts:**
```bash
# via CLI flags (can use multiple -v)
ralphex -v /data:/mnt/data:ro -v /models:/mnt/models docs/plans/feature.md

# via environment variable (comma-separated)
RALPHEX_EXTRA_VOLUMES="/data:/mnt/data:ro,/models:/mnt/models" ralphex docs/plans/feature.md
```

**Extra environment variables:**
```bash
# via CLI flags (can use multiple -E)
ralphex -E DEBUG=1 -E API_KEY docs/plans/feature.md

# via environment variable (comma-separated)
RALPHEX_EXTRA_ENV="DEBUG=1,LOG_LEVEL=verbose" ralphex docs/plans/feature.md

# name-only form inherits value from host (recommended for secrets)
export API_KEY=secret123
ralphex -E API_KEY docs/plans/feature.md

# values containing commas require -E flag (env var splits on commas)
ralphex -E "TAGS=foo,bar,baz" docs/plans/feature.md
```

**Debugging:**
```bash
ralphex --dry-run docs/plans/feature.md  # show docker command without executing
```

The `--dry-run` flag prints the full `docker run` command that would be executed. Useful for debugging container configuration or copying the command for manual execution.

Note: inherited env vars (`-E FOO` without `=value`) won't work when copying the command to a different shell. Use explicit values for portability.

**Updating:**
```bash
ralphex --update         # pull latest docker image
ralphex --update-script  # update the wrapper script itself
```

<summary>Available images</summary>

Two images are published:

| Image | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ghcr.io/umputun/ralphex:latest` | Base image with Claude Code, Codex, and core tools |
| `ghcr.io/umputun/ralphex-go:latest` | Go development (extends base with Go toolchain) |

**Base image includes:**

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Claude Code | latest | AI coding assistant |
| Codex | latest | External code review |
| fya | latest | Optional claude print-mode wrapper (PTY-backed) |
| Node.js/npm | 24.x | Required for Claude Code |
| Python/pip | 3.x | Scripts and automation |
| git | 2.x | Version control |
| docker-cli | - | Docker client for container workflows |
| make | 4.x | Build automation |
| gcc, musl-dev | - | C compiler for native extensions |
| bash | 5.x | Shell |
| fzf | - | Fuzzy finder for plan selection |
| ripgrep | - | Fast search (used by Claude Code) |

**Go image adds:**

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Go | 1.26.0 | Go compiler and runtime |
| golangci-lint | latest | Go linter |
| moq | latest | Mock generator |
| goimports | latest | Import formatter |

**For Go projects**, use the `-go` image:
```bash
RALPHEX_IMAGE=ghcr.io/umputun/ralphex-go:latest ralphex docs/plans/feature.md
```

**For other languages**, create a custom image by extending the base with your language toolchain. The Go image (`Dockerfile-go`) shows the pattern:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/umputun/ralphex:latest

# install go from official distribution
ARG GO_VERSION=1.26.0
RUN ARCH=$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/') && \
    wget -qO- "https://go.dev/dl/go${GO_VERSION}.linux-${ARCH}.tar.gz" | tar -xz -C /usr/local

ENV GOROOT=/usr/local/go
ENV GOPATH=/home/app/go
ENV PATH="${PATH}:${GOROOT}/bin:${GOPATH}/bin"

# install go tools
RUN wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/HEAD/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin && \
    GOBIN=/usr/local/bin go install github.com/matryer/moq@latest && \
    GOBIN=/usr/local/bin go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```

Same approach for Rust, Java, or any other language:
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/umputun/ralphex:latest

# rust
RUN apk add --no-cache rust cargo
ENV CARGO_HOME=/home/app/.cargo PATH="${PATH}:${CARGO_HOME}/bin"

# java
RUN apk add --no-cache openjdk21-jdk
ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk PATH="${PATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/bin"
```

Add `ENV RALPHEX_CLI_UPDATE=1` to your image if you want it to refresh claude/codex to the latest npm release on every container start, the way `ralphex-go` does. The base image leaves it off.

Build and use:
```bash
docker build -t my-ralphex -f Dockerfile.python .
RALPHEX_IMAGE=my-ralphex ralphex docs/plans/feature.md
```

</details>

Example with custom port:
```bash
RALPHEX_PORT=3000 ralphex --serve --port=3000 docs/plans/feature.md
```

## Usage

**Note:** ralphex must be run from the repository root directory (where `.git` is located).

```bash
# execute plan with task loop + reviews
ralphex docs/plans/feature.md

# select plan with fzf, or create one interactively if none exist
ralphex

# review-only mode (skip task execution)
ralphex --review docs/plans/feature.md

# external-only mode (skip tasks and first review, run only external review loop)
ralphex --external-only

# codex executor mode (run task, review, and finalize phases through codex; skip external review)
ralphex --codex docs/plans/feature.md

# codex executor mode with project CLAUDE.md passthrough (codex reads CLAUDE.md as AGENTS.md)
ralphex --codex --pass-claude-md docs/plans/feature.md

# tasks-only mode (run only task phase, skip all reviews)
ralphex --tasks-only docs/plans/feature.md

# run in isolated git worktree (full and tasks-only modes only)
ralphex --worktree docs/plans/feature.md

# override default branch for review diffs
ralphex --review --base-ref develop
ralphex --review --base-ref abc1234 --skip-finalize

# initialize local .ralphex/ config in current project (commented-out defaults)
ralphex --init

# interactive plan creation
ralphex --plan "add user authentication"

# with custom max iterations
ralphex --max-iterations=100 docs/plans/feature.md

# limit external review iterations (0 = auto, derived from max-iterations)
ralphex --max-external-iterations=5 docs/plans/feature.md

# terminate external review after 3 unchanged rounds (stalemate detection)
ralphex --review-patience=3 docs/plans/feature.md

# wait and retry on rate limit (instead of exiting)

# use a stronger model for plan creation
ralphex --plan-model=fable:high --plan="add caching"

# use different models for tasks and reviews
ralphex --task-model=opus --review-model=sonnet:low docs/plans/feature.md

# use provider overrides for one run without editing config
ralphex --claude-command=/path/to/codex-as-claude.sh --external-review-tool=custom --custom-review-script=/path/to/review.sh docs/plans/feature.md

# set per-session timeout to kill hanging sessions (external review in Claude mode excluded)
ralphex --session-timeout=30m docs/plans/feature.md

# kill claude/codex executor session when no output for 5 minutes
ralphex --idle-timeout=5m docs/plans/feature.md

## Plan File Format

Plans are markdown files with task sections. Each task has checkboxes that claude marks complete.

```markdown
# Plan: Add User Authentication

## Overview
Add JWT-based authentication to the API.

## Validation Commands
- `go test ./...`
- `golangci-lint run`

### Task 1: Add auth middleware
- [ ] Create JWT validation middleware
- [ ] Add to router for protected routes
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Mark completed

### Task 2: Add login endpoint
- [ ] Create /api/login handler
- [ ] Return JWT on successful auth
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Mark completed
```

**Requirements:**
- Task headers must use `### Task N:` or `### Iteration N:` format (N can be integer or non-integer like `2.5`, `2a`)
- Checkboxes: `- [ ]` (incomplete) or `- [x]` (completed)
- Checkboxes belong only in Task sections (`### Task N:` or `### Iteration N:`). Do not put checkboxes in Success criteria, Overview, or Context — they cause extra loop iterations. The agent handles them gracefully when present, but plan authors should avoid them for best behavior.
- Include `## Validation Commands` section with test/lint commands
- Place plans in `docs/plans/` directory (configurable via `plans_dir`)

## Review Agents

The review pipeline is fully customizable. ralphex ships with sensible defaults that work for any language, but you can modify agents, add new ones, or replace prompts entirely to match your specific workflow.

### Default Agents

These 5 agents cover common review concerns and work well out of the box. Customize or replace them based on your needs:

| Agent | Phase | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `quality` | 1st & 2nd | bugs, security issues, race conditions |
| `implementation` | 1st & 2nd | verifies code achieves stated goals |
| `testing` | 1st only | test coverage and quality |
| `simplification` | 1st only | detects over-engineering |
| `documentation` | 1st only | checks if docs need updates |

### Agent Options (Frontmatter)

Agent files support optional YAML frontmatter for per-agent configuration:

```txt
---
model: haiku
agent: code-reviewer
---
Review the code for quality issues...
```

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `model` | `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `fable` | Claude model for this agent |
| `agent` | any string | Claude Code Task tool subagent type |

Both options are optional. Without frontmatter, agents use default model and `general-purpose` subagent type. Full model IDs (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) are normalized to short keywords (`sonnet`) since Claude Code only accepts `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `fable`. Invalid model values are dropped with a warning.

### Template Syntax

Custom prompt files support variable expansion. All variables use the `{{VARIABLE}}` syntax.

**Available variables:**

| Variable | Description | Example value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `{{PLAN_FILE}}` | Path to the plan file being executed | `docs/plans/feature.md` |
| `{{PROGRESS_FILE}}` | Path to the progress log file | `.ralphex/progress/progress-feature.txt` |
| `{{GOAL}}` | Human-readable goal description | `implementation of plan at docs/plans/feature.md` |
| `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` | Default branch name (overridable via `--base-ref` or `default_branch` config) | `main`, `master`, `origin/main` |
| `{{agent:name}}` | Expands to Task tool instructions for the named agent | (see below) |

**Agent references:**

Reference agents in prompt files using `{{agent:name}}` syntax:

```
Launch the following review agents in parallel:
{{agent:quality}}
{{agent:implementation}}
{{agent:testing}}
```

Each `{{agent:name}}` expands to Task tool instructions that tell Claude Code to run that agent. Variables inside agent content are also expanded, so agents can use `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` or other variables.

### Customization

The entire system is designed for customization - both task execution and reviews:

**Agent files** (`~/.config/ralphex/agents/`):
- On first run, ralphex installs 5 default agent files as commented-out templates. These serve as examples — while fully commented out, they are inactive and the embedded defaults are used instead. Uncomment and edit to customize
- Per-file fallback: for each agent, ralphex checks local `.ralphex/agents/` → global `~/.config/ralphex/agents/` → embedded default. The 5 embedded agents are always the baseline — deleting an agent file from disk does not disable it, the embedded version is used as fallback
- To disable a specific agent, remove its `{{agent:name}}` reference from the prompt files (`review_first.txt`, `review_second.txt`), not the agent file itself
- Add new `.txt` files to create custom agents (reference them in prompts with `{{agent:name}}`)
- Run `ralphex --init` to create local `.ralphex/` project config with commented-out defaults
- Run `ralphex --reset` to interactively restore defaults, or delete all files manually
- Run `ralphex --dump-defaults <dir>` to extract raw defaults for comparison
- Use the `/ralphex-update` Claude Code skill to smart-merge updated defaults into customized files
- Alternatively, reference agents already installed in your Claude Code directly in prompt files (see example below)

**Prompt files** (`~/.config/ralphex/prompts/`):
- `task.txt` - task execution prompt
- `review_first.txt` - comprehensive review (default: 5 language-agnostic agents - quality, implementation, testing, simplification, documentation; customizable)
- `codex.txt` - codex evaluation prompt (Claude evaluates codex output)
- `codex_review.txt` - codex review prompt (sent to codex external review tool)
- `custom_review.txt` - custom external review prompt (sent to custom review script)
- `custom_eval.txt` - custom evaluation prompt (Claude evaluates custom tool output)
- `review_second.txt` - final review, critical/major issues only (default: 2 agents - quality, implementation; customizable)
- `make_plan.txt` - interactive plan creation prompt
- `finalize.txt` - optional finalize step prompt (disabled by default)

**Comment lines and markdown headers:**
A leading block of 2+ contiguous comment lines (starting with `#`) at the top of a file is treated as a meta-comment and stripped when loading. A single `# Title` at the top is preserved (treated as a markdown header). Comment lines appearing later in the file body are always preserved:

```txt
# This single title line is preserved as a markdown header
check for SQL injection
# this mid-body comment is also preserved
check for XSS
```

Files containing *only* comment lines (every line starts with `#`) are treated as unmodified templates and fall back to embedded defaults. This is how commented-out default files work — once you add any non-comment content, the file is used as-is.

Note: Inline comments are not supported (`text # comment` keeps the entire line).

**Examples:**
- Add a security-focused agent for fintech projects
- Remove `{{agent:simplification}}` from prompt files if over-engineering isn't a concern
- Create language-specific agents (Python linting, TypeScript types)
- Modify prompts to change how many agents run per phase

**Using Claude Code agents directly:**

Instead of creating agent files, you can reference agents installed in your Claude Code directly in prompt files:

```txt
# in review_first.txt - just list agent names with their prompts
Agents to launch:
1. qa-expert - "Review for bugs and security issues"
2. go-test-expert - "Review test coverage and quality"
3. go-smells-expert - "Review for code smells"
```

## Requirements

- `claude` - Claude Code CLI
- `fzf` - for plan selection (optional)
- `codex` - for external review (optional)
- `gemini` - alternative provider for Claude phases (optional, via `scripts/gemini-as-claude/`)
- `agy` - Antigravity CLI, alternative provider for Claude phases (optional, via `scripts/agy-as-claude/`)
- `pi` - alternative provider for Claude phases (optional, via `scripts/pi-as-claude/`)
- `bob` - IBM Bob Shell CLI 2.0.0+, alternative provider for Claude phases (optional, via `scripts/bob-as-claude/`; bob 1.0.x is not supported by the wrapper)

## Configuration

ralphex uses a configuration directory at `~/.config/ralphex/` (override with `--config-dir` or `RALPHEX_CONFIG_DIR`) with the following structure:

```
~/.config/ralphex/
├── config              # main configuration file (INI format)
├── prompts/            # custom prompt templates
│   ├── task.txt
│   ├── review_first.txt
│   ├── review_second.txt
│   ├── codex.txt
│   ├── codex_review.txt
│   ├── custom_review.txt
│   ├── custom_eval.txt
│   ├── make_plan.txt
│   └── finalize.txt
└── agents/             # custom review agents (*.txt files)
```

On first run, ralphex creates this directory with default configuration.

**Commented templates:**
- Config files are installed with all content commented out (`# ` prefix)
- Uncomment only the settings you want to customize
- Files that remain all-commented receive automatic updates with new defaults
- Once you uncomment any setting, the file is preserved and won't be overwritten

### Local Project Config

Projects can override global settings with a `.ralphex/` directory in the project root. Run `ralphex --init` to create it with commented-out defaults:

```
project/
├── .ralphex/           # optional, project-local config
│   ├── config          # overrides specific settings
│   ├── prompts/        # custom prompts for this project
│   └── agents/         # custom agents for this project
```

**Priority:** CLI flags > local `.ralphex/` > global `~/.config/ralphex/` > embedded defaults

Use `--config-dir` or `RALPHEX_CONFIG_DIR` to override the global config location. This is useful for maintaining separate agent/prompt sets for different workflows.

Provider-related CLI flags (`--claude-command`, `--claude-args`, `--external-review-tool`, and `--custom-review-script`) follow the same priority and override config only for the current invocation. This is useful for switching wrappers or review tools without maintaining separate config directories.

**Merge behavior:**
- **Config file**: per-field override (local values override global, missing fields fall back)
- **Prompts**: per-file fallback (local → global → embedded for each prompt file)
- **Agents**: per-file fallback (local → global → embedded for each agent file, same as prompts)

### Configuration options

| `claude_args` | Claude CLI arguments | `--dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json --verbose` |
| `executor` | Executor for plan creation, task, review, and finalize phases. `""` (default) uses Claude Code; `codex` routes the full pipeline through the codex CLI and skips the external review phase. CLI flag `--codex` takes precedence | empty |
| `pass_claude_md` | When `executor = codex`, pass project `CLAUDE.md` to codex as `AGENTS.md` via `-c project_doc_fallback_filenames=["CLAUDE.md"]`. CLI flag `--pass-claude-md` takes precedence | `false` |
| `plan_model` | Model for plan creation as `model[:effort]` (e.g., `opus`, `opus:high`, `:medium`). Falls back to `task_model` if empty. Same syntax and wrapper behavior as `task_model`. Under `--codex`, selects the codex plan-creation model/effort instead (see *Model selection under `--codex`*) | empty |
| `task_model` | Model for task execution as `model[:effort]` (e.g., `opus`, `opus:high`, `:medium`). Effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Appended as `--model <m>` and/or `--effort <e>` to `claude_command`; custom wrappers may ignore or implement the flags. Under `--codex`, selects the codex task-phase model/effort instead (see *Model selection under `--codex`*) | empty |
| `review_model` | Model for review phases as `model[:effort]`. Falls back to `task_model` if empty. Same syntax and wrapper behavior as `task_model`. Under `--codex`, selects the codex review-phase model/effort | empty |

| `codex_timeout_ms` | Codex timeout in ms | `3600000` |
| `codex_sandbox` | Sandbox mode. External codex review defaults to `read-only`; first-class `executor = codex` uses `danger-full-access` (task/review/finalize need to write git metadata and commit) unless explicitly overridden | `read-only` (claude mode) / `danger-full-access` (codex mode) |
| `external_review_tool` | External review tool (`codex`, `custom`, `none`) | `codex` |

| `preserve_anthropic_api_key` | Pass `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` through to the claude child process (for users authenticating Claude Code via API key rather than OAuth/keychain). Default `false` strips the key so a host-set value cannot silently override OAuth credentials | `false` |
| `plans_dir` | Plans directory | `docs/plans` |
| `default_branch` | Override auto-detected default branch for review diffs | auto-detect |
| `vcs_command` | VCS command for the git backend (set to a translation script for hg repos) | `git` |

| `session_timeout` | Per-session timeout for task/review executor (e.g., `30m`, `1h`). Applies to Claude calls in default executor mode and every executor call under `executor = codex`; external codex/custom review in Claude mode is not affected | disabled |
| `idle_timeout` | Kill executor session when no output for specified duration (e.g., `5m`). Resets on each output line. Applies to the claude executor in default mode and to every executor call under `--codex`; external codex review in default-claude mode is NOT affected (preserves master behavior). Custom review is also not affected | disabled |

Colors use 24-bit RGB (true color), supported natively by all modern terminals (iTerm2, Kitty, Terminal.app, Windows Terminal, GNOME Terminal, Alacritty, Zed, VS Code, etc). Older terminals will degrade gracefully. Use `--no-color` to disable colors entirely.

Error patterns use case-insensitive substring matching. When a pattern is detected in claude or codex output, ralphex exits gracefully with an informative message suggesting how to check usage/status. Multiple patterns are separated by commas, with whitespace trimmed from each pattern.

**Transient retry:** Claude retry patterns (`claude_retry_patterns`) are checked before limit and error patterns. They cover wrapper-level stalls such as fya's `FYA_TRANSIENT_TIMEOUT` and transient server-side HTTP errors (`API Error: 529` Overloaded and the `502`/`503`/`504` gateway errors); matches are retried through the existing timeout-style phase path and do not use `wait_on_limit`, so they recover automatically without `--wait`. The task and review retry loops wait a short fixed backoff (5s) before re-running the failed iteration. `API Error: 500` is intentionally excluded — it can be a deterministic server failure and is caught by the enumerated `API Error: 500` error pattern instead. `BOB_TRANSIENT_ERROR` is an opaque marker the bob wrapper emits when bob fails with a transient backend or network cause (a backend 5xx, `socket hang up`, `ECONNRESET`); the wrapper classifies the cause and only emits it on an actual failure, so no English phrase in this list can collide with review prose that merely discusses one.

**Rate limit retry:** Limit patterns (`claude_limit_patterns`, `codex_limit_patterns`) work similarly but support optional wait+retry behavior. When `--wait` is set (or `wait_on_limit` in config), a limit pattern match triggers a wait followed by automatic retry instead of exiting. Without `--wait`, limit patterns fall through to error pattern behavior. Limit patterns are checked before error patterns — if the same string matches both, the limit pattern takes priority when wait is enabled.

**Note for upgrades:** the codex defaults are tightened so review findings that *talk about* rate limiting in a codebase do not trip a false positive. Earlier defaults (`Rate limit,quota exceeded` or `Rate limit,quota exceeded,You've hit your usage limit`) substring-matched any text containing "rate limit", which fired on findings text when codex exited non-zero for an unrelated reason. Users who customized `codex_limit_patterns` or `codex_error_patterns` keep their values on update; comment the line out to inherit the new embedded default. The phrase `You've hit your usage limit` is retained because codex emits it on stderr when the ChatGPT plan quota is exhausted, and it never appears in findings text.

### Custom prompts

Place custom prompt files in `~/.config/ralphex/prompts/` to override the built-in prompts. Missing files fall back to embedded defaults. See [Review Agents](#review-agents) section for agent customization.

### Custom External Review

Use your own AI tool for external code review instead of codex. This allows integration with OpenRouter, local LLMs, or any custom pipeline.

**Configuration:**

```ini
# in ~/.config/ralphex/config
external_review_tool = custom
custom_review_script = ~/.config/ralphex/scripts/my-review.sh
```

For a one-off run without editing config, use `--external-review-tool=custom --custom-review-script=/path/to/script.sh`.

**Script interface:**

Your script receives a single argument: path to a prompt file containing review instructions. The script outputs findings to stdout - ralphex passes them to Claude for evaluation and fixing.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# example: ~/.config/ralphex/scripts/my-review.sh
prompt_file="$1"

# read the prompt (contains diff instructions, goal, review focus)
prompt=$(cat "$prompt_file")

# call your AI tool (OpenRouter, local LLM, etc.)
# example with curl to OpenRouter:
curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"model\": \"anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet\",
    \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": $(echo "$prompt" | jq -Rs .)}]
  }" | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'
```

**Expected output format:**

- Write findings to stdout as a structured list
- Use format: `file:line - description of issue`
- Output `NO ISSUES FOUND` when there are no problems

**Iteration behavior:**

The external review loop runs up to `max(3, max_iterations/5)` iterations by default. Override with `max_external_iterations` config option or `--max-external-iterations` CLI flag (0 = auto).

The prompt's `{{DIFF_INSTRUCTION}}` variable adapts per iteration:
- **First iteration**: `git diff main...HEAD` (all changes in feature branch)
- **Subsequent iterations**: `git diff` (only uncommitted changes from previous fixes)

This lets the review tool focus on remaining issues after fixes.

### Notifications

ralphex can send notifications when execution completes or fails. Notifications are optional, disabled by default, and best-effort - failures are logged but never affect the exit code.

```ini
# in ~/.config/ralphex/config or .ralphex/config
notify_channels = telegram, webhook
notify_telegram_token = 123456:ABC-DEF
notify_telegram_chat = -1001234567890
notify_webhook_urls = https://hooks.example.com/notify
```

Supported channels: `telegram`, `email`, `slack`, `webhook`, `custom` (script). Misconfigured channels are detected at startup.

See [notifications documentation](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/docs/notifications.md) for setup guides, message format examples, and custom script integration.

**Prompt customization:**

Customize `~/.config/ralphex/prompts/custom_review.txt` to modify the prompt sent to your script. Available variables:
- `{{DIFF_INSTRUCTION}}` - git diff command appropriate for current iteration
- `{{GOAL}}` - human-readable description of what's being implemented
- `{{PLAN_FILE}}` - path to the plan file
- `{{PROGRESS_FILE}}` - path to progress log with previous review iterations
- `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` - detected default branch (main, master, etc.)
- `{{PREVIOUS_REVIEW_CONTEXT}}` - previous review context (empty on first iteration, populated on subsequent)

Customize `~/.config/ralphex/prompts/custom_eval.txt` to modify how Claude evaluates your tool's output.

**Docker considerations:**

When running ralphex in Docker, your script must be accessible inside the container:
- Mount your scripts directory: `-v ~/.config/ralphex/scripts:/home/app/.config/ralphex/scripts:ro`
- Ensure script dependencies are available (curl, jq, etc. are included in base image)
- Environment variables (API keys) must be passed to container: `-e OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

### Using Alternative Providers for Claude Phases

The `claude_command` and `claude_args` config options let you replace Claude Code with any CLI that produces compatible `stream-json` output. Compatible wrappers can drive plan creation, task execution, internal reviews, and finalize; each wrapper's section documents which phases and signal workflows it supports. Use `--claude-command` and `--claude-args` to choose a wrapper for a single run without changing config.

Working examples are included:

- [`scripts/codex-as-claude/codex-as-claude.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/codex-as-claude/codex-as-claude.sh) wraps codex to produce Claude-compatible events
- [`scripts/copilot-as-claude/copilot-as-claude.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/copilot-as-claude/copilot-as-claude.sh) wraps GitHub Copilot CLI and translates its native JSONL stream into Claude-compatible events
- [`scripts/gemini-as-claude/gemini-as-claude.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/gemini-as-claude/gemini-as-claude.sh) wraps Gemini CLI for the implementation slot
- [`scripts/agy-as-claude/agy-as-claude.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/agy-as-claude/agy-as-claude.sh) wraps the Antigravity (`agy`) CLI — Google's successor to Gemini CLI — for the implementation slot
- [`scripts/opencode/opencode-as-claude.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/opencode/opencode-as-claude.sh) wraps OpenCode CLI for the implementation slot, and `scripts/opencode/opencode-review.sh` is shipped alongside as a turn-key custom review script
- [`scripts/pi-as-claude/pi-as-claude.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/pi-as-claude/pi-as-claude.sh) wraps the pi CLI, translating its `--mode json` JSONL events into Claude-compatible events
- [`scripts/bob-as-claude/bob-as-claude.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/bob-as-claude/bob-as-claude.sh) wraps the IBM Bob Shell CLI (2.0.0+), translating its `bob run -f stream-json` events into Claude-compatible events

The Bob wrapper requires bob 2.0.0 or newer — it runs `bob run -f stream-json --mode=<slug> --trust` and contains no v1 compatibility layer. bob v2 has no model selection, so `--model`, `--effort`, and `BOB_MODEL` are accepted, noted on stderr, and ignored.

It ships `scripts/bob-as-claude/modes/ralphex-task.yaml`, `ralphex-review.yaml`, and `ralphex-plan.yaml`. Install them with `bash scripts/bob-as-claude/install-modes.sh` before automatic phase selection. The installer safely merges into Bob's active global `~/.bob/settings/custom_modes.yaml`, preserves a legacy `~/.bob/custom_modes.yaml` for Bob's migration path, preserves unrelated modes, and leaves existing ralphex slugs as user-owned overrides. Project-level `.bob/custom_modes.yaml` entries take precedence; remove an existing ralphex entry before reinstalling when you want the latest shipped definition. Automatic selection maps review start markers to `ralphex-review`, the complete `QUESTION`/`PLAN_DRAFT`/`PLAN_READY` signal set to `ralphex-plan`, and task/finalize prompts to `ralphex-task`; `BOB_CHAT_MODE=<slug>` overrides this mapping with any built-in or custom slug.

Headless `bob run` has no approval prompt and does not read the `approval` section of `~/.bob/settings/settings.json` — bob's approval engine is reachable only from the interactive TUI's tool handler, which `bob run` never constructs (hence `--auto-approve` on `bob chat` but not on `bob run`). What bob may call headlessly comes from the active mode's `groups` list plus the always-passed `--trust`, so installing the modes is the whole setup step; a stock install with `allowed_permissions: ["read"]` and `autoApprovalEnabled: false` runs task and review phases fine. Neither the wrapper nor the installer writes to `settings.json`. To narrow a phase's access, drop a group from the corresponding `modes/*.yaml`. Review runs use bob v2's native subagents in parallel and consolidate their findings; because subagent activity emits no stream events, give bob review phases a generous or disabled `idle_timeout`. Plan runs validate and stop at the first complete boundary detected in assistant text, and fail closed when none arrives.

To use the included Copilot wrapper:

```ini
# in ~/.config/ralphex/config or .ralphex/config
claude_command = /path/to/scripts/copilot-as-claude/copilot-as-claude.sh
```

Authenticate with `copilot login` or set one of `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Set `COPILOT_MODEL` to choose the model.
The wrapper runs Copilot in native autopilot mode with `--autopilot --no-ask-user --allow-all` so task and review phases can continue across multiple model turns without manual intervention.
For ralphex plan creation, it switches to `--autopilot --allow-all` so clarification can surface through `<<<RALPHEX:QUESTION>>>` signals instead of being suppressed by the unattended question path.

To use the included codex wrapper:

```ini
# in ~/.config/ralphex/config or .ralphex/config
claude_command = /path/to/scripts/codex-as-claude/codex-as-claude.sh
```

Or choose it for one invocation:

```bash
ralphex --claude-command=/path/to/scripts/codex-as-claude/codex-as-claude.sh docs/plans/feature.md
```

Wrapper scripts should ignore unknown flags gracefully — the included script does this via its `*) shift ;;` catch-all. If a wrapper cannot tolerate the default Claude flags (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--output-format stream-json`, `--verbose`), use `--claude-args=` to explicitly clear configured/default args for that single run.

The included Codex, Copilot, pi, and bob wrappers require `jq` on `PATH` for JSON translation. The Bob wrapper also requires `awk` for fence-aware phase detection.

Provider-specific environment variables:
- `COPILOT_MODEL`, `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Copilot model selection and headless authentication
- `CODEX_MODEL` - codex model to use (default: codex default)
- `CODEX_SANDBOX` - sandbox mode (default: `danger-full-access`)
- `CODEX_VERBOSE` - set to `1` to include command execution output in the stream (default: `0`, only agent messages are shown)
- `PI_PROVIDER`, `PI_MODEL`, `PI_THINKING` - pi provider, model, and thinking-level selection (used when ralphex does not append `--model`/`--effort`)
- `PI_VERBOSE` - set to `1` to include tool execution events in the stream (default: `0`, only assistant text is shown)
- `PI_EXTRA_ARGS` - extra flags appended verbatim to the pi invocation (word-split on whitespace); e.g. `--nolo-mode full` to auto-approve tools in non-interactive runs
- `BOB_CHAT_MODE` - bob mode slug override passed to `--mode` (built-in or custom; empty enables automatic phase selection)
- `BOB_MODEL` - accepted for compatibility and ignored; bob v2 stable has no model selection
- `BOB_VERBOSE` - set to `1` to include task/review `tool_result` output, `[tool]` markers, and reasoning text (default: `0`; plan mode emits only a validated boundary)
- `BOB_EXTRA_ARGS` - extra flags appended verbatim to the bob invocation (word-split on whitespace, no quote preservation); e.g. `--max-cost=5` to cap spend
- `BOB_SHELL` - shell bob's `execute_command` runs commands through (default: `bash`). bob passes `$SHELL` through verbatim, so the wrapper pins bash rather than inheriting a login shell like `fish`, under which every heredoc and `VAR=$(...)` the model writes fails

See [custom providers documentation](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/docs/custom-providers.md) for a detailed guide on writing wrappers for other providers.

### Swapping Implementation and Review Roles

The default pairing is Claude for implementation and Codex for external review. The same mechanisms that replace Claude with another tool can also flip the roles, putting another tool in the implementation slot and Claude (or anything else) in the review slot. Combine `claude_command` with `external_review_tool = custom` and `custom_review_script`:

```ini
# in ~/.config/ralphex/config or .ralphex/config
claude_command       = /path/to/scripts/codex-as-claude/codex-as-claude.sh
external_review_tool = custom
custom_review_script = /path/to/scripts/opencode/opencode-review.sh
```

The `claude_command` slot is documented above. The `custom_review_script` slot, including the script interface and expected output format, is documented in [Custom External Review](#custom-external-review).

The repository ships a working custom review script at [`scripts/opencode/opencode-review.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/opencode/opencode-review.sh) that uses OpenCode CLI to produce review findings. Use it directly, or read it as a template when writing your own (for example, a `claude-as-review.sh` that calls Claude in the review slot).

The wrappers under `scripts/codex-as-claude/`, `scripts/copilot-as-claude/`, `scripts/gemini-as-claude/`, `scripts/agy-as-claude/`, `scripts/opencode/`, `scripts/pi-as-claude/`, and `scripts/bob-as-claude/` ship in the source tree but are not bundled with the binary. The Bob directory also contains the declarative `modes/` files and `install-modes.sh`; vendor the provider directory you need into your project (`.ralphex/scripts/`) or reference it from a checkout.

**Log labels reflect the slot, not the underlying tool.** Phase output keeps the internal slot names (`claude execution`, `codex execution`) regardless of what `claude_command` and the external review tool resolve to at runtime. With a wrapper in place, "claude execution" means whatever `claude_command` points at.

**Per-project config on feature branches.** If tool-swap configuration lives inside the project (`.ralphex/config`, scripts under `.ralphex/scripts/`), commit those files on the default branch before creating a feature branch. Otherwise the reviewer sees its own infrastructure as new in the feature branch, which can trigger `RALPHEX:TASK_FAILED` when project rules forbid modifying `.ralphex/`. Keeping the configuration in `~/.config/ralphex/` instead avoids that case entirely.

### Configurable VCS Backend

ralphex can work with Mercurial repositories through the `vcs_command` config option and custom prompt files.

```ini
# in ~/.config/ralphex/config or .ralphex/config
vcs_command = ~/.config/ralphex/scripts/hg2git.sh
```

A reference translation script is included at [`scripts/hg2git/hg2git.sh`](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/scripts/hg2git/hg2git.sh). It maps the ~15 git subcommands ralphex uses internally to Mercurial equivalents, with phase-based commit logic (amend on draft, commit on public). Requires bash 4.0+ (for associative arrays used in diff stats parsing).

You will also need to customise prompt files to replace git commands that Claude executes as bash commands during reviews. See [Mercurial support documentation](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/docs/hg-support.md) for full setup instructions, prompt replacement examples, `.hgignore` setup, and known limitations.

<details markdown>
<summary><b>FAQ</b></summary>

**I installed ralphex, what do I do next?**

Create a plan file in `docs/plans/` (see [Quick Start](#quick-start) for format), then run `ralphex docs/plans/your-plan.md`. ralphex will create a branch, execute tasks, and run reviews automatically.

**Why are there two review phases?**

First review is comprehensive (5 agents by default), second is a final check focusing on critical/major issues only (2 agents). See [How It Works](#how-it-works).

**How do I use my own Claude Code agents?**

Reference them directly in prompt files by name, e.g., `qa-expert - "Review for bugs"`. See [Customization](#customization).

**What if codex isn't installed?**

Codex is optional. If not installed, the codex review phase is skipped automatically.

**Can I run just reviews without task execution?**

Yes, use `--review` flag to run the full review pipeline (Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4) on changes already on the current branch. This works for changes made by any tool — Claude Code's built-in mode, manual edits, other agents, etc. Switch to the feature branch, commit your changes, and run `ralphex --review`. See [Review-Only Mode](#review-only-mode) for details.

**Can I run ralphex in a non-git directory?**

Not directly, but ralphex supports Mercurial repos through the `vcs_command` config option and a translation script. See [Configurable VCS Backend](#configurable-vcs-backend) for setup.

**What if my repository has no commits?**

ralphex prompts to create an initial commit when the repository is empty. This is required because ralphex needs branches for feature isolation. Answer "y" to let ralphex stage all files and create an initial commit, or create one manually first with `git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"`.

**Should I run ralphex on master or a feature branch?**

For full mode, start on master - ralphex creates a branch automatically from the plan filename. For `--review` mode, switch to your feature branch first - reviews compare against master using `git diff master...HEAD`.

**How do I restore default agents after customizing?**

Run `ralphex --reset` to interactively reset global config. Select which components to reset (config, prompts, agents). Alternatively, delete all `.txt` files from `~/.config/ralphex/agents/` manually. To smart-merge updated defaults into customized files (preserving your changes), use the `/ralphex-update` Claude Code skill or `ralphex --dump-defaults <dir>` to extract defaults for manual comparison.

**How do I disable a default agent?**

Deleting an agent file from `~/.config/ralphex/agents/` does not disable it — the embedded default is used as fallback. To disable a specific agent, edit the prompt files (`review_first.txt`, `review_second.txt`) and remove the `{{agent:name}}` reference for that agent.

**How does local .ralphex/ config interact with global config?**

Priority: CLI flags > local `.ralphex/config` > global `~/.config/ralphex/config` > embedded defaults. Each local setting overrides the corresponding global one—no need to duplicate the entire file. For agents: per-file fallback (local → global → embedded), same as prompts. Override one agent without copying all others.

**What happens to uncommitted changes if ralphex fails?**

Ralphex commits after each completed task. If execution fails, completed tasks are already committed to the feature branch. Uncommitted changes from the failed task remain in the working directory for manual inspection.

**What if ralphex is interrupted mid-execution?**

Completed tasks are already committed to the feature branch. To resume, re-run `ralphex docs/plans/<plan>.md`. Ralphex detects completed tasks via `[x]` checkboxes in the plan and continues from the first incomplete task. For review sessions, simply restart. Reviews re-run from iteration 1, but fixes from previous iterations remain in the codebase.

**Can I adjust the plan or change direction while ralphex is running?**

Yes, two approaches depending on the situation:

1. **Edit CLAUDE.md** — for behavioral changes (coding style, libraries, constraints). Each task runs in a fresh Claude Code session that reads CLAUDE.md at startup, so changes take effect on the next task or iteration automatically. No need to stop ralphex.

2. **Stop, edit plan, re-run** — for structural changes (reorder tasks, add/remove tasks, change requirements). Press Ctrl+C to stop, edit the plan file (uncheck `[x]` → `[ ]` to redo tasks, add new tasks, modify descriptions), then re-run `ralphex docs/plans/<plan>.md`. Ralphex picks up from the first incomplete task and adapts to the updated plan.

**What's the difference between progress file and plan file?**

Progress file (`.ralphex/progress/progress-*.txt`) is a real-time execution log—tail it to monitor. Plan file tracks task state (`[ ]` vs `[x]`). To resume, re-run ralphex on the plan file; it finds incomplete tasks automatically.

**Do I need to commit changes before running ralphex?**

It depends. If the plan file is the only uncommitted change, ralphex auto-commits it after creating the feature branch and continues execution. If other files have uncommitted changes, ralphex shows a helpful error with options: stash temporarily (`git stash`), commit first (`git commit -am "wip"`), or use review-only mode (`ralphex --review`).

**What's the difference between agents/ and prompts/?**

Agents define *what* to check (review instructions). Prompts define *how* the workflow runs (execution steps, signal handling).

**Can I run a custom step before or after all tasks complete?**

Yes. Customize `prompts/task.txt` to inject extra steps at any point in the task lifecycle. A common pattern is adding a "gate step" that runs after all tasks are done but before signaling completion. For example, to run a code smells check after the last task:

```txt
STEP 3 - COMPLETE (after validation passes):
- ...existing steps...
- If NO more [ ] checkboxes in the entire plan, proceed to STEP 4

STEP 4 - STYLE CHECK (only when all tasks are done):
- Use /smells skill to analyze all files changed on this branch
- Fix all reported style and code quality issues
- Run tests and linter again to verify fixes
- Commit fixes if any: fix: address code smell findings
- Output exactly: <<<RALPHEX:ALL_TASKS_DONE>>>
```

This works because ralphex only checks for the `ALL_TASKS_DONE` signal — it doesn't care how many steps precede it. The same approach works for any tool or skill: security scanning, formatting, documentation generation, etc. Place it in `~/.config/ralphex/prompts/task.txt` for global use or `.ralphex/prompts/task.txt` for a specific project.

**Can I use ralphex with Claude Pro plan?**

Yes. Pro plans hit rate limits more frequently. Use `--wait` to pause and retry automatically instead of exiting:

```bash
ralphex --wait=1h docs/plans/feature.md
```

When a rate limit is detected, ralphex waits the specified duration and retries. Execution takes longer but completes unattended. You can also set `wait_on_limit = 1h` in config to make it the default.

**Can I use Cursor CLI instead of Claude Code?**

Yes. [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) is community-tested as a drop-in alternative. Configure in `~/.config/ralphex/config`:

```ini
claude_command = agent
claude_args = --force --output-format stream-json
```

Key differences: `agent` command (not `claude`), `--force` flag (not `--dangerously-skip-permissions`). Stream format and signals are compatible. *Note: this is community-tested, not officially supported. Compatibility depends on Cursor maintaining Claude Code compatibility.*

**Can I use codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, or another model for task execution instead of Claude?**

Yes. Use one of the included wrapper scripts that translate provider output to Claude's stream-json format:

```ini
claude_command = /path/to/scripts/copilot-as-claude/copilot-as-claude.sh
```

For Copilot, authenticate with `copilot login` or one of `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and set `COPILOT_MODEL` if you want to override the default model.
The included Copilot wrapper runs Copilot in native autopilot mode with `--autopilot --no-ask-user --allow-all` for unattended task and review execution.
For ralphex plan creation, it switches to `--autopilot --allow-all` so clarification can surface through `<<<RALPHEX:QUESTION>>>` signals instead of being suppressed by the unattended question path.

Codex works the same way through its wrapper:

```ini
claude_command = /path/to/scripts/codex-as-claude/codex-as-claude.sh
```

Set `CODEX_MODEL` env var to choose the model. See [Using Alternative Providers](#using-alternative-providers-for-claude-phases) and [custom providers documentation](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex/blob/master/docs/custom-providers.md) for the included Copilot example and for writing wrappers for other tools.

**How do I use multiple Claude accounts?**

Set the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to point to the alternate Claude config directory:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude2 ralphex docs/plans/feature.md
```

This is the same env var Claude Code itself uses. With Docker, the wrapper script mounts the specified directory and derives the correct macOS Keychain service name from the path. Without Docker, the env var passes through to the child Claude Code process directly. Each Claude installation stores credentials under a unique Keychain entry based on its config directory. No additional configuration is needed — just point `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to the right directory.

**Can I run something after all phases complete (notifications, rebase commits, etc.)?**

Yes. Enable the finalize step with `finalize_enabled = true` in config. It runs once after successful review phases (best-effort—failures are logged but don't block success). The default `finalize.txt` prompt rebases onto the default branch and optionally squashes commits into logical groups. Customize `~/.config/ralphex/prompts/finalize.txt` for other actions like sending notifications, pushing to remote, or running custom scripts.

## Web Dashboard

The `--serve` flag starts a browser-based dashboard for real-time monitoring of plan execution.

```bash
ralphex --serve docs/plans/feature.md
# web dashboard: http://localhost:8080
```

### Features

- **Real-time streaming** - SSE connection for live output updates
- **Phase navigation** - filter by All/Task/Review/Codex phases
- **Collapsible sections** - organized output with expand/collapse
- **Text search** - find text with highlighting (keyboard: `/` to focus, `Escape` to clear)
- **Auto-scroll** - follows output, click to disable
- **Late-join support** - new clients receive full history

The dashboard uses a dark theme with phase-specific colors matching terminal output. All file and stdout logging continues unchanged when using `--serve`.

### Multi-Session Mode

The `--watch` flag enables monitoring multiple ralphex sessions simultaneously:

```bash
# watch specific directories for progress files
ralphex --serve --watch ~/projects/frontend --watch ~/projects/backend

# configure watch directories in config file
# watch_dirs = /home/user/projects, /var/log/ralphex
```

Multi-session features:
- **Session sidebar** - lists all discovered sessions, click to switch (keyboard: `S` to toggle)
- **Active detection** - pulsing indicator for running sessions via file locking
- **Auto-discovery** - new sessions appear automatically as they start

## Claude Code Integration (Optional)

ralphex works standalone from the terminal. Optionally, you can add slash commands to Claude Code for a more integrated experience.

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ralphex` | Launch and monitor ralphex execution with interactive mode/plan selection |
| `/ralphex-plan` | Create structured implementation plans with guided context gathering |
| `/ralphex-adopt` | Convert plans from various source formats (OpenSpec, spec-kit, GitHub/GitLab issues, generic task-lists, free-form markdown) into ralphex-format plans |
| `/ralphex-update` | Smart-merge updated embedded defaults into customized prompts/agents |

### Installation

The ralphex CLI is the primary interface. Claude Code skills (`/ralphex`, `/ralphex-plan`, `/ralphex-adopt`, and `/ralphex-update`) are optional convenience commands.

**Via Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)**

```bash
# Add ralphex marketplace
/plugin marketplace add umputun/ralphex

# Install the plugin
/plugin install ralphex@ralphex
```

Benefits: Auto-updates when marketplace refreshes (at Claude Code startup).

**Manual Installation (Alternative)**

The slash command definitions are hosted at:
- [`/ralphex`](https://ralphex.com/assets/claude/ralphex.md)
- [`/ralphex-plan`](https://ralphex.com/assets/claude/ralphex-plan.md)
- [`/ralphex-adopt`](https://ralphex.com/assets/claude/ralphex-adopt.md)
- [`/ralphex-update`](https://ralphex.com/assets/claude/ralphex-update.md)

To install, ask Claude Code to "install ralphex slash commands" or manually copy the files to `~/.claude/commands/`.

### Usage

Once installed:

```
# in Claude Code conversation
/ralphex-plan add user authentication    # creates plan interactively
/ralphex docs/plans/auth.md              # launches execution
"check ralphex"                          # gets status update
```

The `/ralphex` command runs ralphex in the background and provides status updates on request. The `/ralphex-plan` command guides you through creating well-structured plans with context discovery and approach selection.

> **Note:** ralphex automatically strips the `CLAUDECODE` env var from child processes, allowing it to run from inside Claude Code. However, running from a standalone terminal is still recommended for the best experience. If the nested session error is somehow encountered, ralphex detects it via error pattern matching and exits gracefully.
